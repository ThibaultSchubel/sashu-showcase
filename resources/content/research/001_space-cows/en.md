For a Prague-based POS material  design studio, we developed an innovative and interactive demonstrator.

The system is built on a simple yet powerful architecture:
* A screen,
* A mini-computer,
* A webcam.
* 
Inspired by the Space Invaders universe, the game casts the player as a missile launch base, tasked with destroying asteroids sent by aliens—while carefully avoiding cows.

Designed for retail environments, this demonstrator offers contactless interaction: players control the game solely through head movements, detected in real time by the webcam. The system can even recognize returning players, enabling personalized experiences.

Fully customizable, it can be tailored to match a brand’s colors and visual identity.

Beyond entertainment, the demonstrator collects demographic data (such as player gender and estimated age), providing brands with valuable insights to better understand their audience and refine their marketing strategies.
