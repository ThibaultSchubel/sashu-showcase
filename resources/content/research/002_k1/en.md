To demonstrate our expertise in software development and electronics, we designed an intelligent cosmetic display. This project showcases our ability to blend design, interactivity, and advanced technologies to create an immersive and personalized customer experience.

The display integrates several technologies:

* A __touchscreen__ with a custom, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing graphical interface,
* __Distance sensors__ to detect the presence of a customer in front of the display,
* __Addressable LEDs__ for dynamic and customizable light animations,
* __RFID readers__ to identify displayed products and trigger targeted interactions. 

A smooth and engaging interaction scenario:

Customer detection: As soon as a customer approaches, the distance sensors activate the system.
1.	__Adaptive light animations:__ The LEDs respond in real time to the customer’s distance, creating an immersive visual atmosphere.
2. __Visual experience:__ The customer can watch a video or presentation on the touchscreen.
3. __Product interaction:__ When a product is picked up, the RFID reader instantly identifies it and displays a detailed presentation on the screen.
4. __In-depth exploration:__ The customer can interact with the screen to access additional information, demonstrations, or personalized advice.
5. __Data collection__ for real-time analysis of purchasing behaviors.
