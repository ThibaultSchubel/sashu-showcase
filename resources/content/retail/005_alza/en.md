For its new retail location in central Vienna, [Alza](https://www.alza.at/) the Czech leader in electronics distribution—wanted a space built around three core components:

* A coffee shop,
* A counter for product pickups,
* A dedicated area for showcasing PC components.

SaShu for Retail was tasked with designing the "product pickup" and "component presentation" areas. Our primary goal was to introduce visitors to PC assembly and peripherals in an engaging way. As a result, the customer experience leans more toward an interactive museum than a traditional electronics store.

Customers can also place orders on-site, consult with specialists, and pick up their pre-ordered packages.
