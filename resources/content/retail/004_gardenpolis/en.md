In 2023, Strommy Company s.r.o. set out to create [Gardenpolis](https://www.gardenpolis.cz/) in Bruntál, Czech Republic—a garden center spanning over 1,000 m² of indoor space. Far more than just a retail outlet, this project is designed to be a central hub for community life, fostering social cohesion and interaction among local residents.

To bring this vision to life, we created several dedicated zones for gathering and learning:

* __A coffee shop__ for socializing over a drink,
* __A workshop space__ for hosting sessions on gardening, DIY, ecology, and more,
* __An outdoor educational area__ specifically designed for children, to raise awareness about nature and sustainable development.

The customer journey is designed as a leisurely stroll, blending indoor and outdoor pedestrian paths. The layout combines the loop-style customer flow with the grid-based organization of supermarkets. it encourages visitors to spend time exploring without imposing a rigid path.

[Gardenpolis](https://www.gardenpolis.cz/) aims to be a showcase for sustainable development. To achieve this, the project incorporates eco-responsible solutions, such as:

* 100% renewable electricity production through rooftop solar panels,
* A rainwater harvesting system, with collected water reused for irrigating green spaces and crops.
