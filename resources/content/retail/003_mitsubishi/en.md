In 2019,  [Mitsubishi Motors](https://www.mitsubishi-motors.cz/) unveiled its new visual identity, including a complete redesign of its showrooms. SaShu for Retail was commissioned to adapt this concept to the Czech and Slovak markets, implementing it across 44 local dealerships.

We coordinated the project’s execution, ensured compliance with the original design, and collaborated closely with the Japanese headquarters to maintain the brand’s global consistency.
