Originally a B2B distributor of manicure products, [Nani Nails](https://www.naninails.cz/)   launched its own network of retail stores across the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
We were commissioned to design the first pilot store, which will serve as the blueprint for all future locations.

Our creative approach is built on three pillars:
* __Clarity and lightness:__ A refreshing space with unobstructed sightlines, offering customers an immediate and comprehensive view of the product range.
* __Optimal product showcase:__ Sleek, minimalist displays designed to highlight each product, even in compact spaces.
* __Scenographic inspiration:__ An atmosphere drawn from theater, film studios, and the world of showbiz. One wall, transformed into a stage, spotlights the NaniNails logo as the star of the show.

This space is designed to deliver a memorable and immersive customer experience. Aesthetics meet functionality.
