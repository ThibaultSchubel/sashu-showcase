In 2018, [Don Pealo](https://www.donpealo.cz/), a Czech retailer specializing in alcohol and tobacco, sought to reimagine the interior layout of its stores. The goal was to attract a new clientele seeking premium products while retaining its existing customer base. Most of its stores are located in shopping centers, positioned near supermarket checkouts.

The customer journey was designed to remain simple and intuitive, ensuring regular customers would not feel disoriented. The storefront remained unchanged, preserving its immediate recognition. However, a striking suspended structure featuring the brand’s logo was installed at the entrance. This eye-catching element instantly draws attention and enhances the store’s visibility.

The interior layout is organized as follows:
* The cigar humidor is strategically placed at the entrance, within the natural flow of foot traffic, to appeal to premium product enthusiasts.
* A central gondola showcases the newly introduced high-end wines.
* Wall gondolas retain the usual product selection, ensuring continuity for existing customers.
* A large counter is positioned at the back of the store as in the previous layout.

Materials and colors were carefully selected to create a timeless and inviting atmosphere:
* Wood, brick, and dark tones evoke a classic, elegant style.
* Thoughtfully redesigned lighting enhances product visibility and highlights their appeal, while fostering a warm and sophisticated ambiance.
